# Mathlib definitions used by the Chvátal–Pósa statements

Verbatim excerpts of the Mathlib definitions used by the statements in `Challenge.lean`, at the
pinned Mathlib revision `c55e6e786f49471c72fbddbec5415808896aec1e` (tag `v4.35.0-rc3`, repository
https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4). Mathlib is released under the Apache-2.0

These excerpts are provided so that the meaning of every imported notion used by the
Challenge can be audited without fetching Mathlib.

## SimpleGraph

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Basic.lean`, line 95:

```lean
/-- A simple graph is an irreflexive symmetric relation `Adj` on a vertex type `V`.
The relation describes which pairs of vertices are adjacent.
There is exactly one edge for every pair of adjacent vertices;
see `SimpleGraph.edgeSet` for the corresponding edge set.

## SimpleGraph.neighborFinset

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Finite.lean`, line 169:

```lean
/-- `G.neighborFinset v` is the `Finset` version of `G.neighborSet v` in case `G` is
locally finite at `v`. -/
def neighborFinset : Finset V :=
  (G.neighborSet v).toFinset
```

## SimpleGraph.degree

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Finite.lean`, line 242:

```lean
/-- `G.degree v` is the number of vertices adjacent to `v`. -/
def degree : ℕ := #(G.neighborFinset v)
```

## SimpleGraph.Walk

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Walk/Basic.lean`, line 54:

```lean
/-- A walk is a sequence of adjacent vertices.  For vertices `u v : V`,
the type `walk u v` consists of all walks starting at `u` and ending at `v`.

We say that a walk *visits* the vertices it contains.  The set of vertices a
walk visits is `SimpleGraph.Walk.support`.

See `SimpleGraph.Walk.nil'` and `SimpleGraph.Walk.cons'` for patterns that
can be useful in definitions since they make the vertices explicit. -/

## SimpleGraph.Walk.IsTrail

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Paths.lean`, line 69:

```lean
/-- A *trail* is a walk with no repeating edges. -/
@[mk_iff isTrail_def]
structure IsTrail {u v : V} (p : G.Walk u v) : Prop where
  edges_nodup : p.edges.Nodup
```

## SimpleGraph.Walk.IsCircuit

```lean
/-- A *circuit* at `u : V` is a nonempty trail beginning and ending at `u`. -/
@[mk_iff isCircuit_def]

  ne_nil : p ≠ nil
```

## SimpleGraph.Walk.IsCycle

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Paths.lean`, line 84:

```lean
/-- A *cycle* at `u : V` is a circuit at `u` whose only repeating vertex
is `u` (which appears exactly twice). -/
structure IsCycle {u : V} (p : G.Walk u u) : Prop extends isCircuit : IsCircuit p where
  support_nodup : p.support.tail.Nodup
```

## SimpleGraph.Walk.IsHamiltonian

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Hamiltonian.lean`, line 38:

```lean
/-- A Hamiltonian path is a walk `p` that visits every vertex exactly once. Note that while
this definition doesn't contain that `p` is a path, `p.isPath` gives that. -/
def IsHamiltonian (p : G.Walk a b) : Prop := ∀ a, p.support.count a = 1
```

## SimpleGraph.Walk.IsHamiltonianCycle

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Hamiltonian.lean`, line 155:

```lean
/-- A Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits every vertex once. -/
structure IsHamiltonianCycle (p : G.Walk a a) : Prop extends p.IsCycle where
  isHamiltonian_tail : p.tail.IsHamiltonian
```

## SimpleGraph.IsHamiltonian

`Mathlib/Combinatorics/SimpleGraph/Hamiltonian.lean`, line 248:

```lean
/-- A Hamiltonian graph is a graph that contains a Hamiltonian cycle.

This is equivalent to there being an Hamiltonian cycle based at each vertex.
See `IsHamiltonian.exists_isHamiltonianCycle`.

By convention, the singleton graph is considered to be Hamiltonian and the empty graph is not. -/

  Fintype.card α ≠ 1 → ∃ a, ∃ p : G.Walk a a, p.IsHamiltonianCycle
